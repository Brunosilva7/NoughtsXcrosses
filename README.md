Hash game created with Javascript language.

Basically we've explored some important concepts of JavaScript language within this project.

## Navigate throught the Arrays and manipulate

First we've created a function to check either the squares has been fill or not, and indicate it to the player

But in the beggining we've declared and separated each square inside an array with some coordinates.

## Math method:

One of the points which we've explored was the Math method to create randomly the turns of each player inside the game.
